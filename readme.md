  The Tone Script Romanization Scheme

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>

The call script encoding uses the Latin script with diacritics to encode most of Earth's natural language features, enough so that you can write every language using the same Latin-oriented system and be close enough to a realistic pronunciation, including nasalized vowels, tense consonants, clicks, and tones, amongst other things.

### Main Symbols

Here are the consonants and vowels in their main form (without tone or stress markers).

</p>

Note, to add "aspiration" to a sound, you add the corresponding "h" symbol after the main symbol. To add nasalization to a vowel, you add a tilde below the vowel. Long vowels are made by writing two vowel letters.

The call script encoding is being developed by the folks at [Mount](https://mount.build), a California-based project for helping humanity master information and computation. Mount started off in the winter of 2008 as a spark of an idea, to forming a company 10 years later in the winter of 2018, to a seed of a project just beginning its development phases. Mount funds call script's development. It is entirely bootstrapped by working full time and running [Etsy](https://etsy.com/shop/mountbuild) and [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?rh=p_27%3AMount+Build) shops.
