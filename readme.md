  The <a href='https://github.com/drumworkteam/tone'>Tone Script</a> Romanization Scheme
</p>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>

The call script encoding uses the Latin script with diacritics to encode most of Earth's natural language features, enough so that you can write every language using the same Latin-oriented system and be close enough to a realistic pronunciation, including nasalized vowels, tense consonants, clicks, and tones, amongst other things.

### Main Symbols

Here are the consonants and vowels in their main form (without tone or stress markers).

</p>

Note, to add "aspiration" to a sound, you add the corresponding "h" symbol after the main symbol. To add nasalization to a vowel, you add a tilde below the vowel. Long vowels are made by writing two vowel letters.

The letter `i#` is roughly `/ɨ/`, which is pronounced with the shape of your lips like a `u`, saying `i`, with the inside of the mouth like an `i`.

The letter `a#` is roughly `/ø/`, which is pronounced with the shape of your lips like a `u`, saying `i`, but with the inside of the mouth like an `e`.

The letter `u#` is roughly `/ɹ/`, which is pronounced like the English `r`. Lips are shaped like a `u`, saying an `e`, with the inside of the mouth like a `U`.

The letter `o#` is roughly `/ɔ/`, which is pronounced like the British English `a`. Lips are shaped like a `o`, saying an `a`.

The letter `e#` is roughly `/œ/`, which is pronounced with the shape of your lips like an `o`, saying an `U`.

The [K](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgtWtDwMIhA) sound is a deeper k sound pronounced at the bottom of your throat.

Ejective sounds are produced like you are beat boxing.

Tones are produced like you are on a musical scale, only slightly less exaggerated.

Retroflex sounds are produced with the tip of the tongue on the high part of the roof of your mouth.

[Pharyngealized sounds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG967iHMnVE) and [Velarized sounds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3pcu5vFjtI) are produced by sucking your tongue back when you say the consonant.

Labial sounds are produced by rounding your lips when saying the sound.

[Palatalized sounds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-W327PH5Ns) are produced with a thin y at after the consonant.

[Chinese retroflex sounds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpQ3IMd4AMg).

## Sound Variation

The `W` is for labialization, `Y` for palatalization, `h` for aspiration, `Q~` for phayrngeal stop, `~` for pharyngealization, `M` for nasalization, and `$` for non-aspirated stop.

## Vowel Symbols

Here are all the possible vowel combinations. The combination elements are: tone (1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, 1 being the lowest, 5 being the highest), nasality, and stress. In languages with only 3 tones you can just use tones 2, 3, and 4, but in languages with 5 tones you need all 5. Nasality is done with a tilde below the vowel. Stress is done with one dot above the vowel. Low tones tilt to the left, high tones to the right.

<h3 id="mount">Mount</h3>

The call script encoding is being developed by the folks at [Mount](https://mount.build), a California-based project for helping humanity master information and computation. Mount started off in the winter of 2008 as a spark of an idea, to forming a company 10 years later in the winter of 2018, to a seed of a project just beginning its development phases. Mount funds call script's development. It is entirely bootstrapped by working full time and running [Etsy](https://etsy.com/shop/mountbuild) and [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?rh=p_27%3AMount+Build) shops. Also find us on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/mountbuild), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mountbuild), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/mountbuild).
